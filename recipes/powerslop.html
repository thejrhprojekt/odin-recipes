    <h1>Powerslop</h1>
    <p>Years ago, a man named Jared was looking for a nutritional solution
        to his busy schedule.  He didn't have time to cook, so he had to 
        come up with a relatively quick meal that was nutritious, not too
        disgusting, and met his macronutrient needs.  What he came up with
        would change the world forever when frickin' Huel pretty much stole
        his idea and made like a trillion dollars with it.  It's best not to
        look at powerslop.  So here's a puppy.
